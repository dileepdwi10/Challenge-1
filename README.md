# Challenge-1
A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

## Solution: 

- I used below 3 application layers for building 3 tier environment -  

FRONTEND RAILS APP

NODE.JS BACKEND API 

CRYSTAL BACKEND API 


## Approach: 

I used below aws services to deliver best approach for this Challenge.

## Microservices:

 Below are the advantages of Microservices-

Services in a microservice architecture are independently deployable.

Services are organized around business capabilities.

Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases, hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best.

Services are small in size, messaging-enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed, independently deployable, decentralized and built and released with automated processes.


## Containerize Application:

 Below are the advantages of Containerize application-

Portability between different platforms and clouds—it’s truly write once, run anywhere.

Efficiency through using far fewer resources than VMs and delivering higher utilization of compute resources.

Agility that allows developers to integrate with their existing DevOps environment.

Higher speed in the delivery of enhancements. Containerizing monolithic applications using microservices helps development teams create functionality with its own life cycle and scaling policies.

Improved security by isolating applications from the host system and from each other.

Faster app start-up and easier scaling.

Easier management since install, upgrade, and rollback processes are built into the Kubernetes platform.


## Amazon Fargate:


AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.


## Amazon ECS:


Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.


## Application Load Balancer (ALB):


 A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application
